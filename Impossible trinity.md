# Impossible trinity

The impossible trinity (also known as the impossible trilemma or the Unholy Trinity) is a concept in international economics and international political economy which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:

- a fixed foreign exchange rate
- free capital movement (absence of capital controls)
- an independent monetary policy

Think of the impossible trinity as a pick-two-out-of-three situation. Imagine you're at an ice cream store, and you're told you can only pick two out of three flavors.

In this scenario:
1. The "fixed foreign exchange rate" is like choosing vanilla ice cream. It means the value of one country's currency stays steady compared to another's.
2. "Free capital movement" is like choosing chocolate ice cream. It means money can flow in and out of a country easily, without restrictions.
3. An "independent monetary policy" is like choosing strawberry ice cream. It means the country can set its own interest rates and control its own money supply without outside influence.

But here's the catch: you can't have all three flavors at once. So a country has to make choices based on what's best for its economy. For example, it might choose vanilla and chocolate (fixed rate and free capital movement), but that means it can't have strawberry (independent monetary policy).

This idea comes from a theory about interest rates and how they balance between countries. It's also something that real-world examples have shown: when governments try to have all three things (stable currency value, free money flow, and their own money rules), they don't succeed. Two guys, John Marcus Fleming and Robert Alexander Mundell, came up with this idea around the same time between 1960 and 1963, but separately from each other.

## Policy choices

Imagine countries are like different banks. Each bank has its own interest rate, which is like the amount of extra money you get for keeping your money there. Now, let's say most banks in the world give you an extra 5% for keeping your money with them, but one particular bank offers only 2%.

Now, think: Where would you want to keep your money? Most people would choose the banks giving 5%, because they get more money back. So, if a bank offers 2%, people will want to move their money elsewhere to get that higher 5% return. This moving of money puts pressure on the value of the country's money with the 2% rate, making it worth less.

If the country with the 2% rate also wants money to move freely in and out (like having an open door policy at a store), it'll face a problem. To stop its money from losing value, it can use its savings of other countries' money (think of it like using special coupons to keep customers). But these savings aren't endless. Once they run out, the country's money value will drop, because they can't offer that higher interest anymore.

This whole idea says that a country's bank can't do everything at once: have a fixed money value, let money move freely, and set its own interest rates. They can only pick two out of these three.

### Options


Imagine a menu at a restaurant, but you can only pick two out of three dishes. Based on the menu (from Oxelheim, 1990):

1. **Option (a)**: You can have a stable money value (like a fixed price for a dish) and allow money to move freely in and out (like letting anyone eat at the restaurant). But, you can't set your own special dish price if it's different from other restaurants, because your dish might become too popular or not popular enough, changing its value.
 
2. **Option (b)**: You can set your own dish price and let anyone eat. But, you can't promise that your dish price will stay the same (it might change every day).

3. **Option (c)**: You can have a stable dish price and set your own dish price. But, you won't let just anyone eat at your restaurant; there are some restrictions on who can come in and eat.

So, countries, like these restaurants, have to decide which two options they want. They can't have all three.
Got it. Here's a more detailed simplification that retains all the information:

Countries in the Eurozone, which use the euro as their currency, have picked the first option (a). This means they keep their money value stable and allow money to flow freely, but they don't set their own individual interest rates.

On the other hand, there's a Harvard professor named Dani Rodrik who believes in the third option (c). He wrote about this in his book called "The Globalization Paradox." In that book, he talks about a time called the Bretton Woods era. During this period, the world's money grew really fast because countries had more control over money coming in and out. Dani Rodrik thinks this was a good thing. 

Moreover, he believes that the reason we're seeing more money problems in different countries today is because money moves too freely. He also has another interesting point. He says that countries can't have three things at the same time: democracy (where people have a say), national control (where countries make their own rules), and being fully part of the global economy. They can only pick two out of these three.

There's a rule in finance called the Interest Rate Parity. It basically says that if there's no extra risk involved, the change in value of one country's money compared to another's will match the difference in their interest rates. Think of interest rates like the "profit" you get from saving money in a bank. Now, when a country fixes its money's value to another country's money (like when the Peso was tied to the US dollar), they can't really decide their own "profit" (interest rate). The Peso, which was set equal to 0.08 US dollars, later lost 46% of its value. This shows that the country fixing its money value can't control its interest rate or have its own financial strategy. The only way to do both - set a fixed money value and decide on its own "profit" - is by stopping people from taking advantage of price differences in international money exchanges. They do this by putting rules on buying and selling money across countries.

Back in the 1980s, a concept known as the "impossible trinity" became a big deal in the world of economics. It started as just an interesting idea, but soon became a cornerstone for understanding global economies. By that time, many countries had removed restrictions on the movement of money across borders (known as capital controls). But this led to challenges. These countries struggled to maintain a fixed value of their currency and also have the freedom to set their own financial rules. The "impossible trinity" suggests that it's really hard for a country to do three things at once: control its currency's value, let money flow freely across its borders, and have independent financial decision-making. And true to this idea, when countries lessened restrictions on money movement, they found it tough to stabilize their currency and make their own financial decisions.

## Trilemma in practice

Back in 1997, two economists, Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor, popularized the term "trilemma" in the world of economics. Along with Jay Shambaugh, they were the first to practically test a crucial theory in international finance. Using an example, economists Michael C. Burda and Charles Wyplosz explain the trilemma concept. Imagine a country that has set a fixed price for its currency (fixed exchange rate) and is balancing the money coming in and out (capital flows) because its financial policies are in sync with the global market. But then, this country decides to pump more money into its system (expansionary monetary policy) hoping to boost its own economy. 

Now, let's explain the technical terms: 

- **Trilemma**: It's like a dilemma, but with three parts. In economics, it refers to a situation where a country can only pick two out of three possible financial strategies, and can't achieve all three at the same time.
- **Fixed exchange rate**: It's like setting a fixed price tag for your country's currency compared to other currencies. So, it doesn't change easily with market conditions. 
- **Capital flows**: This is about the money coming into and going out of a country, like when foreigners invest in a country or when locals invest abroad.
- **Expansionary monetary policy**: This is when a country's central bank tries to boost the economy by increasing the amount of money available, often by lowering interest rates or buying government bonds. It's like trying to get more water flowing in a river to make it more lively.

## Theoretical derivation

When a country pumps more money into its system, two things happen:
1. There's more money available locally.
2. Local interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) go down.

Now, because interest rates in other countries haven't changed, smart players in the market see a chance to make money. They borrow this cheaper money and then lend or invest it in other countries where they can get higher returns â€“ this is like buying something cheap and selling it at a higher price, which is called "carry trade."

If the country doesn't have rules stopping the flow of money across its borders (known as capital control), a lot of people will rush to do this. They'll convert the borrowed money into foreign currency, increasing the supply of the local currency, and making its value drop.

But, if the country had promised to keep its currency's value stable (fixed exchange rate), it will have to step in to stop the value from dropping. They do this by using their savings (foreign exchange reserves) to buy back their own currency. However, this can't go on forever. If the country keeps its policy of pumping more money without change, it'll eventually run out of its savings, leading the currency to lose its value. So, the country ends up failing in one of the three goals of the trilemma and, in the process, makes these market players richer at its own cost.

To support this idea, a study from 2022 showed that during a time when countries were using gold as a standard for their currencies, their reactions to global changes matched the predictions of the impossible trinity.

Here are the explanations for technical terms:

- **Carry trade**: It's a strategy where you borrow money from a place with low interest rates and then invest or lend it somewhere with higher rates, making a profit from the difference.
  
- **Capital control**: Rules that a country puts in place to control the flow of money in and out.
- **Fixed exchange rate**: As mentioned before, it's like setting a fixed price for a country's currency, ensuring it doesn't change easily with market situations.
- **Foreign exchange reserves**: A country's savings, usually in foreign currencies or gold, that it can use in situations like the one described above.
- **Classical Gold Standard period**: A time when countries agreed to tie the value of their currencies to a specific amount of gold. This system was used to bring stability to international trade.


## Possibility of a dilemma

Today, with how quickly we trade goods, services, and money around the world, it's tough for countries to effectively control the flow of money across their borders. This is because there are many ways to bypass these rules due to advanced financial strategies and tools. Plus, trying to control money flow can create its own set of problems. So, not many big countries have successfully put in place strict rules for this.

However, around 2010, some experts, officials, and even the International Monetary Fund (a big global financial organization) started to see some value in having limited controls.

Now, here's where the impossible trinity comes into play again. Without strong rules on money flow, countries face a choice: 
1. They can try to keep their currency's value stable.
2. They can adjust their financial policies to stabilize their economy.

But they can't successfully do both at the same time. Paul Krugman, a famous economist, also highlighted this back in 1999.

Here are explanations for some terms:

- **Capital controls**: As mentioned before, these are rules a country sets up to manage the money coming in and going out.
- **Currency volatility**: This refers to how much and how quickly the value of a country's currency changes.
- **Stabilizing monetary policy**: Financial strategies a country uses to keep its economy steady and healthy, like controlling inflation and unemployment.
- **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**: It's like a world bank that helps ensure the stability of the international monetary system. They help countries with their monetary issues and provide financial advice.
